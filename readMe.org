* Geometric Visualization using Complex Numbers
** Complex Addition
   visualize the addition of two complex numbers
   changing a number and seeing an animation to the new number and
   the new sum

   input z1 and z2
   let z3 = z1 + z2
   0 z1 z2 z3 is a paralellogram

   style z1 z2 z3
   create an svg graphic
   that can auto scale to fit the three nicely
*** view
    app/views/addition.html
*** controller
    scripts/controllers/addition.js
*** directive
    scripts/directives/additionVisualization.js
** Implementation
*** Yeoman Grunt Angular
    grunt server

    a modern webapp

    http://localhost:9000/#/
    
** ToDo

*** add MathJax and mathematical equations
    
*** scale view to fit sum of two given vectors

*** also use canvas for displaying vectors

*** add subtraction, multiplcation and division
