* Geometric Visualization using Complex Numbers
** Complex Addition
   visualize the addition of two complex numbers
   changing a number and seeing an animation to the new number and
   the new sum

   input z1 and z2
   let z3 = z1 + z2
   0 z1 z2 z3 is a paralellogram

   style z1 z2 z3
   create an svg graphic
   that can auto scale to fit the three nicely

   see demo at: http://wbabic.github.io/complex-addition/#/addition
** Implementation
   a modern webapp

   a directive for d3 visualizations
   based on angular-d3-demo by Brian Ford, see
   http://briantford.com/blog/angular-d3.html

*** view
    app/views/addition.html
*** controller
    scripts/controllers/addition.js
*** directive
    scripts/directives/additionVisualization.js

** Installation
   Use node, npm, grunt, yeoman and bower.
   Install d3.

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   npm install -g grunt-cli 
   npm install -g yo bower 
   npm install generator-angular generator-karma 
   yo angular 
   npm install
   bower install angular 
   grunt server 
   bower install angular-resource  
   bower install d3 
   #+END_SRC
** Usage
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   grunt server
   #+END_SRC

   then open
   http://localhost:9000/#/
   and then for 'Addition of Complex Numbers', see
   http://localhost:9000/#/addition
   
** References
** ToDo
*** add MathJax and mathematical equations
*** scale view to fit sum of two given vectors
*** also use canvas for displaying vectors
*** add subtraction, multiplcation and division
